# ML Engineer Notebook Changes Summary

## Model Registry Integration Changes

The following changes need to be made to `notebooks/ml-engineer-core-enhanced.ipynb` to properly use SageMaker Model Registry for model artifact management:

### 1. Update Training Parameters (Cell with training_params)

**Change:**
```python
# OLD:
'output_path': f"s3://{BUCKET_NAME}/model-artifacts/",

# NEW:
'output_path': f"s3://{BUCKET_NAME}/model-registry-artifacts/yolov11-models/",
```

### 2. Replace register_model_in_registry Function

**Replace the entire function with the enhanced version that:**
- Uses Model Registry as authoritative catalog
- Properly references S3 artifacts through registry
- Adds comprehensive metadata and tags
- Includes proper error handling and logging

### 3. Add New Model Registry Functions

**Add these new functions:**
- `get_model_artifacts_from_registry(model_package_arn)` - Retrieve artifacts through registry
- `list_model_artifacts_in_registry(model_package_group_name)` - List registry-managed models

### 4. Update Performance Comparison Function

**Update `get_model_performance_metrics` to:**
- Use Model Registry as primary source
- Access artifacts through registry APIs
- Include registry-managed metadata

### 5. Add Model Registry Architecture Documentation

**Add cell explaining:**
- Model Registry as authoritative catalog
- S3 as storage backend
- Proper access patterns
- Benefits of registry-managed artifacts

## Key Benefits of Changes

1. **Proper Governance**: All model access through Model Registry APIs
2. **Better Organization**: Structured S3 artifact storage
3. **Enhanced Metadata**: Comprehensive model information in registry
4. **Improved Traceability**: Complete lineage from training to deployment
5. **Production Ready**: Follows AWS best practices for model management

## Implementation Status

- [x] README updated with Model Registry architecture
- [ ] Notebook cells updated with new functions
- [ ] Testing and validation completed
- [ ] Documentation committed to repository
