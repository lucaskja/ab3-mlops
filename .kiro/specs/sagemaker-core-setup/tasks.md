# Implementation Plan

This implementation plan focuses on creating a minimal viable setup of AWS SageMaker infrastructure with notebooks for Data Scientists and ML Engineers, along with a pipeline for YOLOv11 model training. It leverages components that have already been implemented in the larger MLOps SageMaker Demo project.

- [ ] 1. Create simplified deployment script for core SageMaker infrastructure
  - Leverage existing IAM roles from task 2 in the MLOps SageMaker Demo
  - Create script to deploy only the essential components needed for SageMaker Studio and YOLOv11 training
  - Add verification of "ab" profile configuration before executing any AWS commands
  - Implement error handling and validation checks
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 2. Configure SageMaker domain and user profiles
  - Write script to create SageMaker domain with appropriate settings using the "ab" AWS profile
  - Add functionality to create Data Scientist user profile using the "ab" AWS profile
  - Add functionality to create ML Engineer user profile using the "ab" AWS profile
  - Ensure all AWS operations use the "ab" profile exclusively
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.5, 5.1_

- [ ] 3. Adapt existing example notebooks for core functionality
  - Simplify existing Data Scientist notebooks from task 3 and 3.3 in the MLOps SageMaker Demo
  - Focus on essential data exploration and preparation functionality
  - Remove complex features not needed for the core setup
  - Include clear instructions and documentation
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 4. Adapt existing ML Engineer notebooks for pipeline execution
  - Simplify existing ML Engineer notebooks from task 8.2 in the MLOps SageMaker Demo
  - Focus on pipeline execution and management functionality
  - Remove complex features not needed for the core setup
  - Include clear instructions and documentation
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Create simplified SageMaker Pipeline for YOLOv11 training
  - Leverage existing pipeline components from task 6 in the MLOps SageMaker Demo
  - Simplify to include only essential training and evaluation steps
  - Configure YOLOv11 training job with appropriate parameters
  - Set up S3 locations for input data and model artifacts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Create streamlined pipeline definition and registration script
  - Simplify existing pipeline orchestration from task 6.5 in the MLOps SageMaker Demo
  - Write script to create and register the simplified SageMaker Pipeline using the "ab" AWS profile
  - Implement parameter validation and error handling
  - Create example pipeline execution configuration
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Implement notebook upload to S3
  - Write functionality to upload simplified example notebooks to S3
  - Configure proper permissions for notebook access
  - Create instructions for importing notebooks into SageMaker Studio
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 5.2_

- [ ] 8. Create focused cleanup script
  - Simplify existing cleanup procedures from task 8.4 in the MLOps SageMaker Demo
  - Write script to delete only the resources created by this core setup using the "ab" AWS profile
  - Implement safety checks to prevent accidental deletion
  - Include detailed logging of cleanup actions
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.5_

- [ ] 9. Create concise documentation and usage instructions
  - Write focused README with architecture overview
  - Create step-by-step setup instructions
  - Add usage guidelines for both user roles
  - Include troubleshooting information
  - _Requirements: 5.2_

- [x] 10. Test end-to-end deployment and functionality
  - Test deployment script in clean environment
  - Verify role-based access controls
  - Test pipeline execution with sample data
  - Validate cleanup script functionality
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
