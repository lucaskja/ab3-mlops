# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive MLOps Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstration using AWS SageMaker, focusing on governance, model monitoring, and pipeline orchestration. The demo will showcase the complete machine learning lifecycle from data ingestion to model deployment, with clear role separation between Data Scientists and ML Engineers, using YOLOv11 for object detection on a drone imagery dataset.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Data Scientist, I want to access and explore the drone imagery dataset in a governed environment, so that I can understand the data characteristics and develop initial model prototypes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Data Scientist accesses the system THEN they SHALL have read-only access to the dataset in the S3 bucket "lucaskle-ab3-project-pv"
2. WHEN a Data Scientist uses SageMaker Studio THEN they SHALL have access to Jupyter notebooks with appropriate ML libraries pre-installed
3. WHEN a Data Scientist explores the dataset THEN the system SHALL provide data profiling and visualization capabilities
4. IF a Data Scientist attempts to access production resources THEN the system SHALL deny access based on IAM policies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an ML Engineer, I want to create and manage automated ML pipelines, so that I can operationalize the models developed by Data Scientists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an ML Engineer accesses the system THEN they SHALL have permissions to create and modify SageMaker Pipelines
2. WHEN an ML Engineer deploys a model THEN the system SHALL automatically create monitoring and logging configurations
3. WHEN a pipeline is executed THEN the system SHALL track all artifacts and metadata in MLFlow
4. IF a pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL send notifications through EventBridge

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want to see clear governance and role separation, so that I can understand how the MLOps platform maintains security and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN they SHALL be authenticated through AWS IAM with role-based permissions
2. WHEN Data Scientists work THEN they SHALL be restricted to development environments only
3. WHEN ML Engineers deploy models THEN they SHALL have access to staging and production environments
4. WHEN any action is performed THEN the system SHALL log all activities for audit purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to train a YOLOv11 model on drone imagery, so that I can demonstrate object detection capabilities in the MLOps pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the training pipeline is triggered THEN the system SHALL use YOLOv11 architecture for object detection
2. WHEN training data is accessed THEN the system SHALL pull from the "lucaskle-ab3-project-pv" S3 bucket
3. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL register the model in the SageMaker Model Registry
4. WHEN model metrics are generated THEN they SHALL be tracked in MLFlow experiments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an ML Engineer, I want comprehensive model monitoring, so that I can detect model drift and performance degradation in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is deployed THEN SageMaker Model Monitor SHALL be automatically configured
2. WHEN model predictions are made THEN the system SHALL capture input data and predictions for monitoring
3. WHEN data drift is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts through EventBridge
4. WHEN monitoring reports are generated THEN they SHALL be accessible through SageMaker Clarify

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete SageMaker Pipeline implementation, so that I can demonstrate end-to-end MLOps automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline is executed THEN it SHALL include data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment steps
2. WHEN each pipeline step completes THEN artifacts SHALL be stored in S3 with proper versioning
3. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN all experiments SHALL be tracked in MLFlow with parameters and metrics
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL create auto-scaling endpoints with monitoring

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want experiment tracking with MLFlow, so that I can compare different model versions and hyperparameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training jobs are executed THEN all parameters SHALL be logged to MLFlow
2. WHEN model evaluation occurs THEN metrics SHALL be automatically recorded in MLFlow
3. WHEN models are compared THEN MLFlow SHALL provide visualization and comparison tools
4. WHEN experiments are queried THEN the system SHALL provide search and filtering capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious stakeholder, I want cost monitoring using the "ab" AWS CLI profile, so that I can track expenses for this PoC demonstration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS resources are created THEN they SHALL use the "ab" CLI profile for cost allocation
2. WHEN cost reports are generated THEN they SHALL be tagged with the PoC project identifier
3. WHEN resources are provisioned THEN they SHALL use cost-optimized instance types where appropriate
4. WHEN the demo is complete THEN cleanup procedures SHALL be documented to minimize ongoing costs

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can understand and replicate the MLOps demo setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is delivered THEN a central README.md SHALL document the complete architecture
2. WHEN setup instructions are provided THEN they SHALL include step-by-step configuration details
3. WHEN code is delivered THEN it SHALL include inline comments and documentation
4. WHEN the demo is presented THEN it SHALL include clear explanations of governance and role separation
