# MLOps SageMaker Demo Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and implementation approach for a comprehensive MLOps demonstration using AWS SageMaker. The solution showcases end-to-end machine learning operations with clear governance, role-based access control, automated pipelines, and comprehensive monitoring using YOLOv11 for object detection on drone imagery.

The architecture emphasizes the separation of concerns between Data Scientists (focused on experimentation and model development) and ML Engineers (focused on operationalization and deployment), while maintaining full traceability and governance throughout the ML lifecycle.
