# SageMaker MLOps Reference Implementation

This steering document provides guidance based on the AWS reference implementation for MLOps with SageMaker: [Amazon SageMaker MLOps: from idea to production in six steps](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-from-idea-to-production).

## Reference Architecture

The reference implementation follows a six-step process for moving from ML idea to production:

1. **Experiment in a notebook** - Initial development and experimentation
2. **Scale with SageMaker processing jobs and Python SDK** - Moving computation to SageMaker
3. **Operationalize with ML pipeline and model registry** - Building automation
4. **Add a model building CI/CD pipeline** - Automating the model building process
5. **Add a model deployment pipeline** - Automating model deployment
6. **Add model and data monitoring** - Ensuring ongoing quality

## Key Components to Incorporate

Our MLOps SageMaker Demo should align with these best practices:

### 1. SageMaker Processing Jobs
- Use SageMaker Processing for data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Create containerized preprocessing scripts with all dependencies
- Implement data validation and quality checks

### 2. SageMaker Pipelines
- Create end-to-end ML workflows with preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment steps
- Store artifacts in S3 with proper versioning
- Implement conditional steps based on model performance metrics

### 3. MLFlow Integration
- Use SageMaker-managed MLflow for experiment tracking
- Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts consistently
- Compare model versions and hyperparameters

### 4. Model Registry
- Register models with proper versioning
- Implement approval workflows
- Track model lineage and metadata

### 5. Model Monitoring
- Configure data quality monitoring
- Implement model quality monitoring
- Set up drift detection and alerting

### 6. CI/CD Integration
- Automate model building and deployment
- Implement testing at each stage
- Use EventBridge for notifications and triggers

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation should follow these principles:

1. **Modularity**: Create reusable components for each stage of the ML lifecycle
2. **Automation**: Minimize manual steps through pipelines and CI/CD
3. **Governance**: Implement role-based access control and audit logging
4. **Monitoring**: Ensure comprehensive monitoring of models and data
5. **Testing**: Include tests at all levels (unit, integration, system)

## Implementation Flow

Based on the reference implementation, our MLOps SageMaker Demo should follow this flow:

1. **Data Preparation and Exploration**
   - Explore the drone imagery dataset
   - Perform data profiling and validation
   - Prepare data for YOLOv11 training

2. **Model Development**
   - Implement YOLOv11 training script
   - Track experiments with MLFlow
   - Evaluate model performance

3. **Pipeline Orchestration**
   - Create SageMaker Pipeline with preprocessing, training, evaluation steps
   - Implement conditional deployment based on model performance
   - Register models in Model Registry

4. **Monitoring and Governance**
   - Set up Model Monitor for data quality and model drift
   - Configure EventBridge alerts for pipeline failures and model drift
   - Implement role-based access control

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automate model building and deployment
   - Implement testing at each stage
   - Set up automated retraining triggers

## Key Differences from Reference Implementation

While we follow the same general approach as the reference implementation, our MLOps SageMaker Demo has some key differences:

1. **Focus on Computer Vision**: We're using YOLOv11 for object detection on drone imagery, while the reference uses a tabular dataset
2. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: We've implemented sophisticated error recovery mechanisms for training jobs
3. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: We've added robust configuration management for different environments
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: We've added extensive unit and integration tests for all components
5. **Role Separation**: We've implemented clear separation between Data Scientist and ML Engineer roles
