# CDK Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Incorrect Properties in LambdaToSagemakerEndpoint Construct**
   - The `endpoint-stack.ts` file was using incorrect properties for the `LambdaToSagemakerEndpoint` construct.
   - The properties `endpointName`, `modelName`, `instanceType`, and `initialInstanceCount` were being passed directly to the construct, but they should be nested under specific property groups.
   - Fixed by restructuring the properties according to the AWS Solutions Constructs documentation:
     - Added `modelProps` with `primaryContainer` configuration
     - Added `endpointProps` with `endpointName` and `endpointConfigName`
     - Added `endpointConfigProps` with `productionVariants` configuration

2. **Missing Lambda Code Path**
   - The CDK was trying to deploy Lambda code from a path that didn't exist.
   - Fixed by:
     - Using `lambda.Code.fromInline()` to provide the Lambda code directly in the CDK stack
     - Removing the S3 bucket and deployment that were trying to upload the Lambda code
     - Updating the `deploy_cdk.sh` script to warn instead of fail when the Lambda code path doesn't exist

3. **Simplified Dependencies**
   - Removed unused imports from the `endpoint-stack.ts` file:
     - Removed `s3` and `s3deploy` imports since we're no longer using S3 for Lambda code
     - Removed `path` and `fs` imports since we're no longer manipulating files

## Successful Synthesis

After making these changes, the CDK app successfully synthesizes without errors. The warnings from the AWS Solutions Constructs are expected and indicate that we're overriding some default values, which is intentional.

## Next Steps

1. **Test Deployment**: The CDK app can now be deployed using the `deploy_cdk.sh` script.
2. **Lambda Code**: Consider creating actual Lambda code in the specified path for production use.
3. **Model Data**: Ensure that the S3 path for the model data exists before deploying to production.
4. **Documentation**: Update any documentation to reflect the changes made to the CDK code.
