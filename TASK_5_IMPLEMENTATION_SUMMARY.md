python scripts/setup/create_core_pipeline.py --profile ab --dry-run
# ✅ Pipeline would be created but not registered
```

### ✅ Integration Testing
- AWS profile verification
- SageMaker domain checking
- S3 bucket access validation
- Python dependency verification

## Usage Workflow

### For ML Engineers
1. **Setup**: Run `./setup_core_pipeline.sh --profile ab`
2. **Prepare Data**: Use Data Scientist notebook to create YOLOv11 datasets
3. **Execute**: Run pipeline with dataset path
4. **Monitor**: Track progress and results
5. **Evaluate**: Review model performance

### Integration with Data Scientists
- Data Scientists use notebooks to transform classification data to YOLOv11 format
- Generated datasets are automatically compatible with the core pipeline
- Seamless handoff from data preparation to model training

## Cost Optimization

### Built-in Cost Controls
- Default to cost-effective GPU instances (`ml.g4dn.xlarge`)
- Configurable training time limits
- Support for spot instances
- Efficient resource utilization

### Recommendations Included
- Start with nano models for testing
- Use appropriate instance types for workload
